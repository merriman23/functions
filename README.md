# functions

# Requirements
- convert length (standard to metric)
- convert volume (standard to metric)
- convert temperature (F to C)

# Scope Creep

- Going beyond the requirements
- Cool if the program had a GUI

# Refactoring 

- Make improvements
    - efficiency
    - DRY - Don't repreat yourself

- Pseudo Code --> In our own words --> logic of the program

# Functions --> DRY
- def nameOfTheFunction(parameter 1, ... parameter n)
